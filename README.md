# SNIKT

[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snikt/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snikt)

**Snikt** (**Slice Nucleotides Into Klassifiable Tequences**) is a program that reports a visual confirmation of adapter or systemic contamination in whole-genome shotgun (WGS) or metagenomic sequencing DNA or RNA reads and trims sequence ends to remove them. It works without prior information about the adapter sequence making it applilcable even when this information is unavailable. The program is written in R which allows for nice visual reports and uses [Seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) in the back-end for handling of fastq data, which is a fast, lightweight tool written in C.

This program is most suitable for long, variable-length reads, for example, from the Oxford Nanopore instruments. This is because read end trimming for long reads does not have a significant impact on the overall read throughput post-cleaning. This program has also been modified to accommodate short, fixed-length (Illumina) reads for identification of adapter contamination, however, end-trimming on such datasets is disabled by default.

## 1. Installation

SNIKT is available on Unix-like platforms (Linux, Mac OS and WSL). The easiest way to use SNIKT, in our opinion, is to use the Conda package management for set up. However, being a wrapper written in R, this program can also be used with a local R installation given it has access to `seqtk` and some R libraries. Both of these setup options are explained below.

### 1.1 Installation via Bioconda

For this setup process to work, you will need to install the Conda package manager and setup Bioconda repositories. Instructions for setting up Bioconda can be found on the [Bioconda installation page](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html). Only setup steps 1 and 2 are needed for this. Once you have the `conda` set up and working, please start a new session.

*Optional: Install and use `mamba` for conda management.*
[Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is a reimplementation of the Conda package manager in C++ and has several benefits over using Conda. It works as a drop-in replacement for `conda` for most Conda commands except for environment activation commands. Full help and instructions can be viewed on the [Mamba GitHub page](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), but for simplicity here is how you can install `mamba` with your `conda` installation.

`$ conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba`

After this installation, `mamba` can be used in the next step (and for management of any other environments/packages). We recommend using `mamba` as the parallelization during installation helps speed up the process of getting several R libraries if your network and storage media allows.

Now SNIKT can be set up in a new environment with the following command.

`$ mamba create -n snikt snikt`

or

`$ conda create -n snikt snikt`

And that's it for the setup with this option. Activate the environment and feel the power of Adamantium blades slicing and dicing nucleotides!
```
$ conda activate snikt
$ snikt.R --version
SNIKT 0.4.0
```
If you ever need to uninstall, you can remove the environment with the following.

`$ conda remove -n snikt --all`

### 1.2 Using a local R installation

While the `conda` installation is easier, we recognize that many users may want to use their local R installation instead of pulling a fresh copy of R and its libraries as a different environment. So, to setup SNIKT in this way, you will need to first get the program `seqtk` from the [Seqtk GitHub page](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). A slightly older version of Seqtk is also available in the `apt` package manager for Ubuntu Linux.

Next, you can install the packages in your R (we recommend R >= 4.0) library. To do this, you can do the following in your R terminal.
```
$ R
R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) -- "Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out"
...

> install.packages( c("tidyverse","gridExtra","docopt","lubridate"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

Now, that the dependencies are set, we can download SNIKT.

`$ git clone https://github.com/piyuranjan/SNIKT.git`

After this download, you can either put the downloaded folder on your system `PATH` or copy the `snikt.R` code to a location that is already on your `PATH`.



## 2. How to use SNIKT

For first time users, we recommend using this program via the interactive method. This program can also run in batch mode if a visual interface in unavailable, for example, on a remote server with SSH.

### 2.1 Interactive mode

This, in our opinion, is the easiest method of using this program.

`$ snikt.R reads.fastq.gz`

This will prepare a temporary graph using top 10K reads from your set and will prompt you to check for contamination. While you check the figure, the prompt will wait for you to pick a trim length. This procedure also implements a default read length filter. If you would like to change that filter, you should kill the execution (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>) and rerun with appropriate options. 

Once you pick trim lengths, the program trims reads, filters them by the length specified and exports them to a fastq file. After that, it prepares a summary report with the following elements.  

![Pre-QC Summary](images/preqc_summary.png)

This part of the summary report is similar to the temporary graph presented to the user for making a decision on trim lengths. It shows a bias in nucleotide compositions and Phred scores suggesting contamination at ends.  

![Post-QC Summary](images/postqc_summary.png)

This part of the summary report shows the effect of trimming and filtering on the reads. This is the report for the post-cleanup reads that were generated as the process of running this program.

### 2.2 Batch mode

The batch mode is useful when the user does not have the capacity to view the temporary graph while the program runs. This is true, for example, if this program is run as a job on a supercomputing cluster. In this scenario, this program can be run in two phases, where the first phase helps with identification of contamination and the second performs cleanup of reads.

`$ snikt.R --notrim reads.fastq.gz`

When running in this mode, the process can also be parallelized for a large library of fastq files with command wrapping in GNU `parallel`. For example, the following command will run the first phase on all fastq files in a directory using `<n>` threads.

`$ parallel -vkj<n> snikt.R -n {} ::: *.fastq.gz`

This step will disable any cleanup process and will prepare a pre-QC report with a 6 panel graph. While this decision is only made with top 10K reads by default, users can use the entire dataset by specifying option `--skim=0`. Use this report to make a decision about trim and filter lengths.  

![No-QC Summary](images/noqc_summary.png)

This report can also be tailored for Illumina reads with the `--illumina` preset option.  

Once a decision is made, user can execute SNIKT again this time with pre-set trim and filter options.

`$ snikt.R --trim5=120 --trim3=25 --filter=1000 reads.fastq.gz`

Or if the trim criteria are same across all fastq, the command can be parallelized on `<n>` threads.

`$ parallel -vkj<n> snikt.R -T 120 -t 25 -f 1000 {} ::: *.fastq.gz`

This step will now clean up reads and will prepare a report pre- and post-cleanup similar to the one generated with the interactive mode. Note that the previous report file will be overwritten unless changed with the option `-o`.

## 5. FAQ

### 5.1 Why the name SNIKT?

We at the University of Michigan are a huge Wolverine fan. So we couldn't pass an opportunity to relate our program that involves identifying (sniffing) and trimming (slashing) nucleotides with our favorite hero. So despite our humble attempt at making a backronym, we have named our program by the sound of Wolverine's claws being drawn - a metallic noise always written as "SNIKT!".

**SNIKT - Slice Nucleotides Into Klassifiable Tequences** 

Imagine the following:

> *Hey adapter, why don't you just back off...*
>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \- Wolverine

And after a <img src="images/snikt_bubble.png" alt="SNIKT!" width="100"/> your read sequences are no longer sequences... they are tequences!

### 5.2 Can this method be used for marker gene (16S) read data?

While this method can technically be used over marker gene sequencing data like the 16S, it is not always easy to pick out sequence over-representation patterns. Still, the adapter sequences are so alike that in our tests we could see a difference in real 16S sequence representation and adapters. That said, the problem will be harder when the community would be dominated by fewer taxonomies with higher similarity in their V3-V4 region of the 16S generally sequenced for such studies. On the other side, most 16S analysis platforms like mothur or QIIME2 have their own protocols for removing read contamination which works well. Adapters also have less of an impact over marker gene sequencing because at some point in the analysis, users align it to a database of marker genes of interest. Analysis protocols can choose to not look at any segments of the read that did not align and completely circumvent any adapter issues. This is not feasible for metagenomic sequencing as it is randomized over entire lengths of genomes in a community.
